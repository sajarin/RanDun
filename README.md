## RanDun 

**RanDun** is a simple suite of procedural dungeon generation algorithms, such as those you might encounter in [old-school roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike), written in C++.

This first batch of algorithms includes [Dunkard's Walk](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:drunkard-walk), and [Cellular Automata](http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:cellular-automata). 

There is still much to improve in my implementation of these algorithms, but they are all under the MIT License, so feel free to use them at your leisure (and improve them if you feel so inclined).
